            hash_contains (str): Filter on alphanumeric characters inside of pin hashes.
              Hashes which do not include the characters passed in will not be returned.
            pin_start (str): ISO_8601 format date str for excluding pin records that were
              pinned before this date.
            pin_end (str): ISO_8601 format date str for excluding pin records that were
              pinned after this date.
            unpin_start (str): ISO_8601 format date str for excluding pin records that were
              unpinned before this date.
            unpin_end (str): ISO_8601 format date str for excluding pin records that were
              unpinned after this date.
            pin_size_min (int): The minimum byte size that pin record you're looking for
              can have.
            pin_size_max (int): The maximum byte size that pin record you're looking for
              can have.
            status (str): Pass in ``"all"`` for both pinned and unpinned records. Pass in
              ``"pinned"`` for just pinned records (hashes that are currently pinned). Pass
              in ``"unpinned"`` for just unpinned records (previous hashes that are no longer
              being pinned on pynata).
